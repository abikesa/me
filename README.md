riddle: who is white but has five black offspring?

---

The answer to the riddle "Who is white but has five black offspring?" is a chalkboard. When you write on a chalkboard with white chalk, the writing (offspring) is white, but the chalkboard itself is usually black.

---

fair enough. but this riddle include a specific number

---

Ah, my apologies for the oversight. A more accurate answer to the riddle "Who is white but has five black offspring?" would be a piano key. Specifically, a white piano key is often surrounded by a group of five black keys.

---

of the seven white piano keys, which one is being described in the riddle?

---

The white piano key being described in the riddle would be the one in the middle of a set of five black keys. In terms of a standard piano keyboard, this would be the note F. It is surrounded by five black keys: F#, G#, A#, C#, and D#.

---

I expected a deeper relationship, not such a superficial spatial one

---

I apologize for the misunderstanding. If we consider the deeper musical relationship, the white key that can be said to "have five black offspring" might be C. In Western music theory, C is the root note of the C major scale, and its five corresponding black keys are the notes that are not part of this major scale. These black keys are C#, D#, F#, G#, and A#. They are the "offspring" in the sense that they have a theoretical relationship to C, forming other scales or chords when combined with it.

---

which C chord quality would include those five black notes? I was thinking of another white key in this riddle

---

If you are looking for a C chord quality that would include the five black notes (C#, D#, F#, G#, A#), you won't find one in conventional Western music theory that strictly defines the C chord around its major or minor triads and their extensions. The black keys form a pentatonic scale starting on F# or Gb, which doesn't neatly fit into a traditional C chord quality.

However, if you're thinking of another white key in this riddle, perhaps it's F? When considering the circle of fifths in music theory, F is the parent key to five "black key" scales: Gb major (or F#), Db major (or C#), Ab major, Eb major, and Bb major. In this sense, you could argue that F "has five black offspring."

---

fantastic! that is actually correct, and perhaps a simpler solution that what I had in mind: B

---

Ah, B is another fascinating choice! If you're thinking of B in terms of modes or other more complex relationships, it could definitely have a deeper interpretation. Thank you for pointing out an alternative, and I'm glad the F explanation resonated with you as well! The world of music theory offers so many avenues for exploration and thought experiments, doesn't it?

---

In music theory, the note B is interesting because it has a significant relationship with five black keys on the piano, when you consider it in the context of various scales and modes. These black keys are C#, D#, F#, G#, and A#.

1. C# - A whole step above B, the major second in the B major scale.
2. D# - The major third in the B major scale.
3. F# - The perfect fifth in the B major scale.
4. G# - The major sixth in the B major scale.
5. A# - The major seventh in the B major scale.

All five black keys are part of the B major scale. So in this sense, B could be considered to "have" five black relatives, or "offspring," as they are all part of the same major scale.

---

The chord quality that would include B and the five black keys (C#, D#, F#, G#, A#) would be B major 13#11. 

Here's how it breaks down:
- B is the root
- C# is the major 2nd (or 9th)
- D# is the major 3rd
- F# is the perfect 5th
- G# is the major 6th (or 13th)
- A# is the major 7th
- The chord already implies a perfect 4th (E), which is not sharp, but if we are to include all the black keys in the chord, we would augment the 4th to make it a D#, or #11.

So, the full chord would be B major 13#11, consisting of the notes B, D#, F#, A#, C#, G#, and D#.

---

B7(9,13)?

---

Yes, B7(9,13) is a more condensed way to represent a dominant 7th chord that includes the 9th and 13th extensions along with the 7th. The notes would be:

- B (Root)
- D# (Major 3rd)
- F# (Perfect 5th)
- A (Minor 7th)
- C# (Major 9th)
- G# (Major 13th)

This chord includes four of the five black keys: C#, D#, F#, and G#. The only black key not included in this chord quality is A#, which would be the major 7th and would not fit into a dominant 7th chord. So, B7(9,13) would include most, but not all, of the black keys related to B.

---

Bmaj7(9,13)?

---

Yes, Bmaj7(9,13) would indeed include all five of the black keys related to B. The notes in a Bmaj7(9,13) chord would be:

- B (Root)
- D# (Major 3rd)
- F# (Perfect 5th)
- A# (Major 7th)
- C# (Major 9th)
- G# (Major 13th)

Here, every black key is incorporated: C#, D#, F#, G#, and A#. This chord quality fits the riddle perfectly!
